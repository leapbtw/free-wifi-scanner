**This software has been created with the sole purpose of scanning around for free networks. It DOES NOT try to connect any device to said networks. Depending on the country in which you're in, there might be legal consequences if you try to connect to a network without the owner consent, or maybe even to scan around for said networks. Please do your own research. If you decide to perform any of these actions on any network that you don't own, do it at your own risk.**
